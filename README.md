# R Shiny App
Development of a desktop application for 'Gene essentiality visualisation at the domain level'
App allows insertion of Tn-seq data and Pfam/InterPro domain annotations
Data needs to be preprocessed to enter clean data into the app, alinging gene IDs and excluding unneccessary information
Results include a table with per gene totals x per domain rows
Results include a plot with domain overlays
Results can be exported as an essentiality report CSV file or an essential domains BED file
